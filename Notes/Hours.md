- Mental Benefit: Improve Spatial Reasoning
- Emotional Benefit: Confidence in Ability to Create Well

(Perhaps the time limit is the cooling of the planet core, you have to rush to create the largest planet possible before the planet cools. As it cools, the planet changes color and start having different layers. At the end, it starts growing plants, etc.)

## Short Description (80 chars)

Build Your Perfect Cube Planet with Your Own Hands using Motion Tracking

## Long Description

Your new planet core is cooling quickly! You don't have much time to add the layers to build up your planet. 

Quickly rotate your planet to add the next layer in the correct position.

If you are fast enough, your planet will support life. If you are even faster that life will thrive.

Use cutting edge motion tracking technology to control the game with your device camera. Or drop down to touch the screen or your game pad if that is more comfortable. Excellent controls maximize your ability to create the perfect planet and maximize your fun.
